Initial bootstrap-based template for the IDFG website.
---------------------------
Codename 'bison' this theme closely mimics the existing site while transferring over to bootstrap.  This theme repository holds the html template for the bison Drupal theme.  This is a downstream repo.  Changes to the bison theme will be migrated here once tested and established.

A second bootstrap-based theme is under production codename 'cervus'.  You may wish to wait to migrate your application to bootstrap until this theme is in production.  If it is a new application, we'd encourage you to use bison.
